# Problem Statement 1
Often people struggle to prioritize their time properly, leading to procrastination and decreased productivity. Many developers have attempted to fix this with planner apps and reminder apps, such as apps like Timo, Neurolist, and general calendar/reminder apps, but none of these solutions work for everyone intuitively. For example, Timo can be very ‘hands on’ with its approach and Neurolist is much too focused on AI generated tasks. These examples can be helpful to some, but a lot of users are pushed away by their difficult and unintuitive design, complicated interfaces, and unreliable or non-existent calendar connections. How can we design a simple and lightweight solution to address these gaps in the existing solutions?

# Problem Statement 2
Procrastination undermines productivity and well-being, leaving individuals overwhelmed by missed deadlines and unfinished tasks. Driven by instant gratification, fear of failure, and poor time management skills, people often prioritize trivial activities over meaningful work. Existing solutions like to-do lists and productivity apps fail when users lack discipline or clear prioritization strategies. Without addressing the root causes of procrastination, individuals risk chronic stress, decreased performance, and lost opportunities for personal and professional growth. How can we develop a solution that not only helps people manage their time effectively but also addresses the barriers that lead to procrastination?

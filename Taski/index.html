    <p>Taski is designed to help users manage their time better by prioritizing tasks and fighting procrastination. Users can easily add tasks, set deadlines, estimate how long each task will take, and mark their importance. The app will have the ability to assign a task without a given time and will automatically schedule it based on availability and priority. Taski will have optimal task ordering based on priority by engaging in high priority tasks first. It sends helpful notifications to remind users of important tasks and alerts them if theyâ€™re about to work on less important ones, especially when time is tight. This way, users can focus on what matters most without feeling overwhelmed. Taski will be of a minimalistic design to avoid the complexity of existing apps.
